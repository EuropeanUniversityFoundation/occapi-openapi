This is an **example** API to demonstrate features of the Open Course Catalogue API specification.

# Introduction

The **Open Course Catalogue API** specification aims to standardize the way in which Higher Education Institutions expose their course catalogues in a machine-readable format.

By facilitating access to their course catalogues, Institutions can allow consumer applications to implement user friendly ways to explore course offers for prospective students.

## Comparison with other standards and specifications

The Open Course Catalogue specification is heavily inspired by the [Erasmus Without Paper](https://www.erasmuswithoutpaper.eu/) API specifications and attempts to follow most of its conventions. However, it takes a different approach to exposing curricular structure as its main focus.

This API specification also differs from EWP APIs by adopting the [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) format following industry trends.

Another example of modern practices in the education space is the [Open Education API](https://open-education-api.github.io/specification/v3/docs.html) which covers a wider array of use cases.
